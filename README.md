# CS 59 A - Stanford Continuing Studies - Final Project 

### Overview 

I am keenly interested in Artificial Intelligence, particular how the tools and techniques of Machine Learning and 
Deep Learning will affect and augment the ways we work today. Below are resources I have personally found to be helpful 
in learning about AI starting from knowing absolutely nothing about the subject, but with a bit of Python
under my belt.

I have also tried to consider differences in learning styles - I personally learn most effectively from a combination of 
[kinesthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinesthetic_learning) as well as [visual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_learning) 
 modalities. But there are many methods to learn this material and everyone learns differently. 
 
 I hope that this is helpful if you are curious to learn more about these fascinating subjects. If you find something 
 you feel is missing or that you have found to be particularly helpful please reach out on Twitter (@Reelkreyz), 
 submit a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/), or please share what you have 
 learned with the community of curious learners on Medium (also @Reelkreyz). 

### Step 1) I hear about AI, ML and Deep Learning all the time, but I am not a Data Scientist and I do not have a Ph.D - What is AI? What is ML? Where do I start? 

##### I don't have time to read books or I don't learn best through reading alone:

###### [AI, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning: A Primer - Frank Chen, Andreesson Horrowitz](https://a16z.com/2016/06/10/ai-deep-learning-machines/) 
###### [Ken Norton - Machine Learning for Product Managers](https://www.kennorton.com/newsletter/2016-07-27-bringing-the-donuts.html)

##### I love reading and learn most effectively by starting with books, then watching videos and tutorials:

###### [Artificial Intelligence - What Everyone Needs to Know, Jerry Kaplan](https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-What-Everyone-Needs/dp/0190602392) 
###### [The Master Algorithm - Pedro Domingos](https://www.amazon.com/Master-Algorithm-Ultimate-Learning-Machine/dp/0465065708) 
###### [Probably Approximately Correct - Leslie Valiant](https://www.amazon.com/Probably-Approximately-Correct-Algorithms-Prospering/dp/0465032710)
###### [Doing Data Science - Cathy O'Neil, Rachel Schutt](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028529.do)

### Step 2) Okay. That all makes sense conceptually, and is fascinating - but can I visualize an example of Machine Learning step-by-step?
 
 ###### Absolutely! [A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning - R2D3](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/) 


### Step 3) This is AMAZING! But I don't know how to code yet - Argh! How can I begin learning how to use Machine Learning tools and techniques?
  
  I have found the below to be helpful (in order), but the learning journey continues: 
  
  1. [Learn Python the Hard Way - Zed Shaw](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)
  2. [Udacity - Data Analyst Skills Checklist](http://blog.udacity.com/data-analyst-skills-checklist-eguide) 
  3. [DATAQUEST](https://www.dataquest.io/)
  4. [Josh Gordon - Machine Learning Recipes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKxRvEZd3Mw&list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIuiBfYad6rFYQU_jL2ryal&index=7)
  
 

Thank you @adam-p for posting a [SUPER helpful Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)for great README docs! 
Thank you [Mohammad Shokoohi-Yekta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammad-shokoohi-yekta-a1300028) for helping us to begin  
working with Python adn introducing our class to the exciting world of AI and Data Science!
